# GIPHY Project 

[Project Link](https://christiehennes.github.io/GIPHY-Project/)

## Instructions
 
 * Click on the predefined buttons to render 10 gifs
 * Once gifs are rendered, you can keep adding more to the page (in groups of 10)
 * Enter your own seach term to add it to the group of buttons


 ## Project Design

 * The project uses a series of functions to process search terms, create buttons, add gifs, make them move, etc
 * I added functionality such that once you view the gifs of a button, you can view more gifs in groups of 10
 * To do this, I used two global variables: 1) to keep track of the batch of gifs we just loaded and 2) remember the search term for the API call
 * I create a mobile responsive app using flex and one media query (to handle phones)
